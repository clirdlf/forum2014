## Green Initiatives

For the 2014 DLF Forum we will continue our green initiatives from prior Forums (offering filtered water instead of bottled and limiting paper materials) and encourage all of our session leaders to use electronic methods of dispersing information, such as Slideshare and Google Drive, instead of handouts.

Our [program](https://2014dlfforum.sched.org/) is on a [mobile app](http://2014dlfforum.sched.org/mobile) and a printable version is available [here](https://2014dlfforum.sched.org/print).

## Community Reporting

The Program Planning Committee needs your help to report on DLF Forum sessions. You may have experienced this “crowdsourced reporting” at other conferences or meetings. The goal is to have a single place where those who cannot attend the session can learn about what was discussed and expand the conversation beyond the Forum. We have created [Google docs](https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0#folders/0B9KcGf1gyIuvM3Y3cDJGUHNscTA), editable by all, that are linked from the individual session pages. We will also try to announce the URLs at the top of each session and via Twitter. If you take notes during a DLF session, please consider doing so on the Google doc for that session and contributing to this community effort!

## Dress Code

Casual. One might even want to wear a Forum t-shirt.

## Code of Conduct

The Digital Library Federation is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. DLF Forum participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Please review the [DLF Code of Conduct](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/ "Code of Conduct") for a full statement on our policies regarding inappropriate conduct and harassment. We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

## Swag

Got stickers or something to share? We will have a swag table. Please keep your items small and plan for 300 attendees. DLF reserves the right to limit what is on the table. [Contact us](mailto:lkwasigroch@clir.org?subject=Forum%20Swag) for shipping instructions or with questions.

## Meet-ups, Tutorials, Birds-of-a-Feather, and Hack Events

Are you interested in hosting or sponsoring an event at/around the Forum? Please [let us know](mailto:lkwasigroch@clir.org?subject=Forum%20Event) ASAP so we can get you on the schedule.
