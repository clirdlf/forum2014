**Notes:** View the [community notes Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17kn8emCIz31Sw-66pq-1ps6KQabkbCcoZfRdlmIhOmQ/ "DevOps for Digital Repositories - community notes") for this session.

**Session Type:** Working Session (lunch)

**Session Description**
Damien Edwards provides a great introduction to DevOps practices in the broader technology world:

“DevOps is, in many ways, an umbrella concept that refers to anything that smooths out the interaction between development and operations. DevOps is a response to the growing awareness that there is a disconnect between what is traditionally considered development activity and what is traditionally considered operations activity. This disconnect often manifests itself as conflict and inefficiency.” ([http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/what-is-devops/](http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/what-is-devops/))

When applied within the digital repository ecosystem, we should also include the needs and goals of repository managers, and engineers, which we argue closely resemble the goals of “DevOps” within traditional IT operations. Repository managers and engineers affect and are affected by the development and operational efforts in and around the repository, and also greatly benefit from the tools and processes that are emerging from the wider “DevOps” movement.

The working session facilitators will first provide a brief overview of DevOps tenets, benefits and barriers that affect the development and operation of repository systems, including: – scalability, monitoring, availability, reporting, and testing. This will be followed by a group discussion around tools currently in use by members of the group that satisfy specific aspects of DevOps and the benefits of and/or barriers/challenges to implementation.
