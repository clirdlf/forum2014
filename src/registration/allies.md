**Notes:** View the [community notes Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psi8vyJIODFf_mI12A4RvLJhw0KSJ_izaNSx3DIg8o4/ "Ally Skills Workshop - community notes") for this workshop.

The [Ally Skills Workshop](https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training/) teaches simple, everyday ways to support women in their workplaces and communities. Participants learn techniques that work at the office, at conferences, and online. The skills taught are relevant everywhere, including those particularly relevant to open technology and culture communities. At the end of the workshop, participants will feel more confident in speaking up to support women, be more aware of the challenges facing women in their workplaces and communities, and have closer relationships with the other participants.
